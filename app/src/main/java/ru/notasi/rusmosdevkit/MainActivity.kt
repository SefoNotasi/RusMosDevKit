 * So basically, using AppCompatActivity is always the right choice.
 * The differences between them are:
 * • Activity is the basic one.
 * • Based on Activity, FragmentActivity provides the ability to use Fragment.
 * • Based on FragmentActivity, AppCompatActivity provides features to ActionBar.

 * Android Documentation recommends using AppCompatActivity if you are using an App Bar.
